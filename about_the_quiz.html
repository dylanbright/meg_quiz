                This quiz is designed to test your knowledge of the <strong>Mortem et Gloriam</strong> rules. The
                questions were generated from the text in the Magna and Maximus pdf edition of the rules published in 2023.

                The questions were generated using OpenAI's LLM APIs. Not all of the questions have been reviewed
                by a human yet, so a few may be a little off of even wrong. It is a work in progress.
            </p>

                The idea for the quiz came about as a product of my speculation on how AI can be used to augment or enhance traditional tabletop wargaming.  Someday we may have a sci-fi robot sitting across the table from us, but right now there may be less dramatic applications of the technology.  One of these may be to help us learn the rules.  
                Standardized multiple choice tests may not have the best reputation these days in modern pedagogy, but drills like this can help a person memorize things.  Wargaming rules still require some memorization if you want to play the game and not rely on the other guy knowing the rules.

                You can choose the chapters from which the questions will be drawn, and customize the number of
                questions for your quiz. After answering all questions, you'll receive feedback on your performance,
                including which questions you answered correctly and incorrectly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Enjoy the quiz and good luck!
